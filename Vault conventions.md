# Vault conventions

## World

Kaelesmuth is the world; [[Aethernam]] and [[Zephyrion]] are planets in it, and the [[Ether]] is a plane of it.

## Folders

One folder per kind of note: Characters, Gods, Places, Organizations, Species, Conditions, Items, Languages, Events, Timelines. Which planet a note belongs to is the `planet` property, not the folder. Importance (main, secondary, key) is the `importance` property.

## Templates

Templates live in `_templates`: Character, Place, Organization, Event. Gods use the Character template with `type: god`. Every note has a `type`, which is what the lists on [[Kaelesmuth World]] are built from.

## Dates

- Years are plain numbers: `born: 2701`, `year: 2758`. Years before 0 (PME) are negative: 1 PME is `-1`.
- A more precise date goes next to it as text: `born_date: "2701-07-09"`, `date: "2758-01-01 01:00"`.
- Every dated note says which calendar it uses: `calendar: aethernam` or `calendar: zephyrion`. The two are not converted yet (see [[Backlog]]).
- Leave a field empty when it's unknown.

## Events

Each event is its own note in `Events`. It lists its `participants`, `location`, `species`, `related` notes and the `timelines` it belongs to. Timelines and the "Events" section of every note are lists that fill themselves from those links, so an event is only ever written once.

## Links

Links in properties are written in quotes: `species: "[[Human]]"`, `affiliations: ["[[Lone Protectors]]"]`.

**Family links** go only on the child: `parents: ["[[Angres Ivan]]", "[[Angres Adelaïde]]"]`, plus `partners` on both partners. Children and siblings are worked out from `parents`, so they are never typed by hand and can't drift out of sync. A family tree is drawn from these properties.

**Membership** is written once, on the character (`affiliations`), never as a member list on the organization. The organization's member list is a query over `affiliations`.

## Status

`status` is `idea`, `draft` or `canon`.
